FinRotate ReadMe

FinRotate is a Mac OS app that analyzes and rotates triggerfish dorsal fin coordinates.
Calculates pseudo fin ray lengths and areas from morphometric data (34 coordinates)
Loads a file of dorsal fin data on open, can also load other files in same format.
Fin coordinate file example: FinData5.txt- each specimen with a string of x first then y coordinates. File adapted and transposed from RData file.

Functionality
1.visually check fin coords for accuracy
2.calculate lengths and areas across fin surface, and output to file
3.flatten fins- make fin base flat on x axis for shape comparison
4.specify fin rotations for every fin ray using editable data entry boxes for fin rotation. Change rot from zero to positive integer, fin section will rotate, areas will be recomputed, and this user input will be recorded as an adjusted fin position. 
5.File output to Desktop:
FinMetrics- fin ray lengths and areas- both raw and rotated
FinFlatCoords- raw data positivized and whole fin rotated to have flat fin x axis
FinSpreadCoords- data positivized and select fin rotations made to “spread the fin”, with complete new data set output.
FinRots- a record of the changes made by user, to adjust fin rotation values from zero to positive integer rotation values (in degrees).
