FinRotate ReadMe

Mac OS app that analyzes and rotates triggerfish dorsal fin or anal fin coordinates
Calculates morphometric pseudo fin ray lengths and areas
Loads dorsal fin data on open, can also load other file in same format.
Fin coordinate files: DorsalFinData.txt  AnalFinData.txt
Functionality
1.	check fin coords for accuracy
2.	calculate lengths and areas
3.	flatten fins- make fin base flat on x axis
4.	specify fin rotations for every fin ray using editable data entry boxes for fin rotation. Change rot from zero to positive integer, fin section will rotate, areas will be recomputed, and this user input will be recorded as an adjusted fin position. 
Fin rays for both dorsal and anal fins move to Left by default. 
Click the box next to a fin ray to make the rotation negative and move the opposite way. 
Switch to next fish or previous fish before SAVE, to make sure the rotations and new coordinates have all been stored. 

5.	File output:
FinMetrics- fin ray lengths and areas- both raw and rotated
FinFlatCoords- raw data positivized and rotated to have flat fin x axis
FinSpreadCoords- data positivized and select rotations made, with complete new data set output.
FinRots- a record of the changes made by user, to adjust fin rotation values from zero to positive integer rotation values (in degrees).
